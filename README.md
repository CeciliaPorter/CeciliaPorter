### Hi there 👋

<!--
**CeciliaPorter/CeciliaPorter** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Calgary (Canada), focusing on how to do more collaborative archaeological work with Inuit communities in Greenland. My main research interests are:

    arctic archaeology
    using digital tools to overcome the field/campus divide for better year-round collaboration with community partners
    collaborative GIS mapping
    public education of heritage using interactive web tools
    the position of power in knowledge production
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... more GIS skills!


In my free time, I enjoy:
🐴 riding and looking after my horse
🏃‍♀️ trail running (with dogs is best 🐕 )
🧗 climbing, hiking, and backpacking
🌱 gardening
